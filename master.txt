## 1. Modern Framework Mastery (Laravel/Symfony)

Most companies with healthy cultures use modern frameworks. Don't just know the syntax; know the "magic" under the hood.

* **Dependency Injection & Service Containers:** Understand how the framework manages classes. This is crucial for writing testable code.
* **ORM Performance (Eloquent/Doctrine):** Know how to avoid the `$N+1$` query problem. Companies care about database efficiency.
* **Middleware & API Design:** Since you want to move toward AI/DevOps, focus on building **RESTful APIs** or **GraphQL**, as these are how AI models are usually consumed.

## 2. Testing & Quality (The Bridge to DevOps)

DevOps is all about automation. You cannot be a DevOps engineer if you don't write automated tests.

* **PHPUnit or Pest:** Be able to write Unit and Integration tests.
* **Static Analysis:** Mention tools like **PHPStan** or **Psalm**. It shows you care about code quality and "type safety" (which is very important in Python as well).

## 3. Containerization (Docker)

This is the **non-negotiable** skill for your "Quick Jump."

* Stop using XAMPP or local installs. Set up your PHP environment using **Docker Compose**.
* Learn how to containerize a PHP-FPM and Nginx stack.
* *Why this helps:* In an interview, when they ask about your workflow, saying "I use Docker for environment parity" immediately puts you in the top 10% of candidates.

## 4. Architecture & Design Patterns

To escape "junior-level" politics, you must speak the language of "Senior" architects.

* **SOLID Principles:** Be able to explain these clearly using PHP examples.
* **Design Patterns:** Focus on **Factory, Strategy, and Observer** patterns. These are used heavily in both PHP frameworks and AI library implementations.

### Comparison: What to Focus on vs. What to Ignore

| **Laravel/Symfony Core**
| **Docker & CI/CD Pipelines** | Manual FTP Uploads |
| **API Authentication (JWT/OAuth)** | Simple Session-based Login |
| **Asynchronous PHP (Queues/Redis)** | Synchronous-only processing |

### Your "Quick-Win" Checklist for this Week:

1. Write a **PHPUnit** test.
2. **Containerize:** Create a `Dockerfile` for a simple PHP script.
3. **Learn Queues:** Understand how PHP handles background jobs (Redis/RabbitMQ).
