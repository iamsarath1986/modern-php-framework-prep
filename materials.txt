Service Container: the engine that stores/resolves dependencies (DI system).
Service Provider: the place where you configure/bootstrap services (register bindings, run startup logic).

Chunk process:

Iteration 1:
    Laravel creates only 1,000 User objects. Memory usage is low (e.g., 20MB).
    It inserts them into the database.
    Crucially: The loop finishes this iteration. The $users variable (holding those 1,000 objects) goes out of scope.
    PHP Garbage Collector runs and frees up that 20MB of memory.
Iteration 2:
    Laravel starts fresh. It creates another 1,000 objects. Memory goes back up to ~20MB (not 40MB).
    It inserts them.
    It frees the memory again.
